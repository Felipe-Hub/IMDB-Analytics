0,1295093,"After watching this movie on Lifetime I have to say that this movie was very good with just a few tiny hiccups. Jamie Luner plays Sandra who suspects that her husband, Matthew is cheating on her when she begins to receive warnings through the mail and email via the computer. She starts to follow him around town, seeing him purchase a set of pearls in a jewelry store and later that day or the next he gives her a ring from the same jewelry store she decides to hire a detective couple to follow him and gain evidence of the affair. What they soon learn is that her husband is not cheating on her and she tells her husband about hiring the detectives. The detectives then start to track down the helpful citizen that sent the emails and letters through the mail. Sandra then has her hands full with an art show debuting her new works of art. The story culminates in Sandra learning that Matthew's partner, Bill has been supposedly stalking her and wants her all for himself. Small inconsistencies in the secondary story with Matthew's partner, Bill. He almost seemed to be a red herring thrown into the mix to blow up and pace and then used as a stalker at the end. The character of Bill just seemed to be tossed into the mix and was never fully fleshed out. Except for the scenes which involve his car being vandalized and popping in and out of the office I never really got a sense of who he was which left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied at the end. Jamie Lunar did a wonderful job with the character of Sandra and I enjoyed watching her interpretation of a wife and artist learning that her husband may be cheating on her and then reacting to the discovery of what her husband was really up to at the end. I believe that this movie was well worth the two hours I spent watching it on a weekend and that others will absolutely enjoy it. 11 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

1,1295093,"***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and both mind numbingly and complicated film that feels like it's a week long 10 to 12 hour mini series not a 90 minute made for Lifetime TV movie. There's the Gunn's Sandra & Matthew, Jamie Luner & Neis Lennarson, an upscale Seattle couple who's hopes and dreams depends on Matthew's Sergecal Tech. company getting the O.K to market this new heart monitor. The monitor will not only revolutionize the world of cardiology but make him and Sandra rich beyond words. It's about that time that Sandra starts getting E-Mails and letters, with no return address or stamp on them, telling her that her husband Matthew is cheating on her. Sandra goes so far as getting private detective Moon(Steven Cree Molison), a guy with a perfect set of white teeth, to check her husband out. As it turns out Moon finds that Matthew in fact is not having an affair with anybody man or woman! Still the letters and E-mails keep coming telling Sandra that her husband is a first class heel and not to believe Moon or anyone else that he's not! It's then that we get to the real heart of the matter in Matthew's assistant the sexy Michelle Jablonski, Crystal Lowe, who discovered a clink in the heart monitor machine that his company is now marketing to the public. There's something wrong with it and if not fixed at once, and also being withdrawn from the market, it may well end up killing dozens if not hundreds of it's users! The only problem now is to keep this news from Matthews's partner in the company and good friend Bill Jackson, Brendan Beiser, from knowing about it. Bill being the honest and ethical person that he is would have the heart monitor withdrawn and thus, in order to save lives, bankrupt the company! ***MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS***(Don't read unless you've already seen the movie) Despite it's overly complicated storyline it doesn't take that long to realize what exactly is going on with Matthew's so-called extra curricular activities with the opposite sex in the film. It's all a shell game on Matthew's part to somehow get Bill out of the way and do it so expertly that even an old hand like PI Moon would be fooled by it! What Matthew didn't quite count on was that in this modern age of high tech computers and mini cell phones the slightest slip up can mean disaster on his part! And that's exactly what happens to him at the very end of the movie! 2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",6
2,1295093,"The painter Sandra Gunn has a fantasy of living in a dream house on 12th Street with her husband Michael. At the opening of the film, Michael is closing a big business deal with the sale of a medical device for heart patients. But Sandra is unaware that Michael knows that the company's heart console is defective and that he will be bilking the buyer and endangering patients. There is an interesting misdirection on the part of the filmmakers that leads to Sandra's concerns about Michael's faithfulness. She hires a sleazy husband-wife team of private investigators to put a tail on Michael. The result is that Michael has never cheated on Sandra, which lulls her into complacency about the depravity of her husband's character. From start to finish, ""Trust"" was an engaging thriller, due in large part to the interesting set of characters. There is a subplot in which Sandra works closely with her partner Alex in a loft. Alex was her former lover, and Sandra may be tempted momentarily to reignite the romance. Her painting also takes an interesting new direction when she examines the question of infidelity. The colorful husband-and-wife team of P.I's was also a lively addition to the film. Michael's partner in the invention of the heart console was Bill, a bon vivant who had a moral compass. It was Bill who insisted that the Dunn company remain in tact because he believed in the integrity of heart device. There was an unintentional comic side to the film in that Michael and Bill never seemed to do any work, but were always on the move, running around to hotels, restaurants, and binge purchases, a swanky car for Bill, jewelry for Michael. In the end, the filmmakers were successful in developing their theme about trust. Sandra may never have her dream home on 12th Street. But she has grown in strength and self-reliance in the personal trial that will test her own fidelity and how much she values the her real experiences over the world of fantasy. 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

3,1295093,"As stories go, based around a wife's suspicions about her husband, Lack of Trust would be a better title. Seriously, if you are married and someone sends you a letter saying that your partner is cheating, you either blow up on the spot and clear the air, or you dismiss it out of hand. UNLESS you have absolutely no self-confidence. We're asked to accept that this woman, who is an artist showing her work, would have so little confidence in herself, and her marriage, that she would automatically assume the worst the instant an anonymous letter arrives. The girl in the detective agency is spot on the money. When the wife goes down that route, the marriage is over. Even if her husband is entirely innocent, she won't be forgetting her suspicions. If she tells him what she's done, how is he ever supposed to trust her again. More overblown shenanigans ensue as the detectives the wife hires blunder around spying on the wrong guy and recording private conversations which have nothing to do with the husband supposedly cheating. There's a strange side plot involving the wife's artist friend who she shares a studio with, and an even stranger relationship where the husband tries to play matchmaker between his partner and the receptionist. Then there is some kind of conspiracy involving the heart monitor that the husband and his partner are betting their all on. It's all a little jumbled and inconsistent, but the acting isn't too bad (considering the short-comings in the plot), and if you like jumbled conspiracy, and can overlook the wife's slightly irrational actions, it isn't that bad. 1 out of 2 found this helpful.

4,1295093,"For once again we are forced to watch this actress (a carbon copy of Judith Light) doing soap opera. Again playing opposite a man she could be the mother of, let alone a wife. After a while it gets boring seeing her dramatize her way through the movie. Wearing obvious sun glasses to disguise herself yet letting her much too long mop of hair blow in the wind. I always wonder why she is constantly covering her face with so much hair, too much hair for a woman of her age. It seems Jamie Luner looks the same in every film she makes. No change in her looks or her acting. Still awful. The gentleman in question played by Nels Lennarson has not choice but to play opposite her. How he must have suffered creating his role. She was that annoying. But that hair. Please somebody give her a haircut and get rid of all that mop. That too is annoying. Once you cut two thirds of it off - COMB IT! 3 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",

But that's a good try for this pretty good B French flick. Good atmosphere but unfortunately not for all audiences. 3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I could only see this sh** 50minutes and actually I think is ancomplishment. The only good thing this movie has is the Depp daughter that I could realize talent as his father in her acting expressions. She looks genuine.

9,8038720,"I don't know why this has so many negative reviews. I started watching after reading them fully expecting to turn off halfway through the first episode, but I found myself enjoying it. It's also quite funny. Noel Clarke and Ashley Walters work well on screen together. Worth a watch in my opinion. It's not a serious gritty cop drama, but then it's not meant to be. Just take it for what it is - a bit of fun! 33 out of 45 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",7
10,8038720,"I'm of an age whom watch Sweeney and The Proffesionals. This series bring it up to date and still has the humour. It's also got 2 stars who work well with each other. It's on my planner...I hope there's a series 2! Clarke is single and moody, Wilson is family man. They both have jobs from hell- dealing with low life's. The Guv' is carol from Easterners. She has her time cut out dealing with Pike and Bishop, as they are keen whippersnappers. If you liked the British cop shows and maybe a few yank ones , you will enjoy this. I've read some of the reviews and most of the negative comments are just, well..negative. It is what it is. It's got bad language, chases and action. It's shot around the London suburbs. I think there's a bit of writers poetic licence but I love it! 18 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",
11,8038720,"As a fan of The Sweeney, Starsky and Hutch and all the old car chase cop shows I thought this was a really good effort to bring the old format up to date having watched the pilot show.

12,8038720,"Personally, my fiancé and I, have thoroughly enjoyed the 4 episodes we've seen so far. We love a good series and something different. Strike back has finished so we needed sonething else to fixate to. Bulletproof brings it all! Fans of the PlayStation game ""The Getaway"" would love this. The soundtrack by Chase and Status really sets the vibe. Look past the reviews of know it all keyboard warriors! If you take it for what is it is, you'll enjoy it. I just hope they renew it for another season! 22 out of 37 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",1
13,8038720,"Ok, its a cross beween the Sweeney,and Lethal Weapon the American tv version of the movie. Its a uk thing,us older tv vets get the premise.  If you did not like it , watch reality tv which will satisfy your need for accuracy. It is only the first episode.! It is a buddy tv show, it will take a few episodes to see if their is chemistry between the main actors works 26 out of 45 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",7

15,8038720,"The only reason I have given this two stars is because of the laugh factor. If you are looking for a realistic, gritty, tough British cop drama then keep looking. If you are looking for an almost comedic parody of how the Americans might imagine this country to be with a bucket load of cliches and massive factual inaccuracies then this is the series for you. Will I watch every episode... of course I will... I enjoy a good laugh 42 out of 84 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",2
16,8038720,"You must be regretting the literally hundreds of pounds probably spent on this steaming pile of a show, Sky, so here's how you can recoup your losses and maybe make a few bob into the bargain: 1. This was clearly written by children for children, so why not hire actors more suited to the lead roles. The Chuckle Brothers are probably available, but if they are in Summer season or rehearsing for panto I'm sure a suitably stuffed envelope sent to their agent would do the job 2. Luckily the script is laughable enough to be largely left alone. Simply get an intern to scribble out the 'Bruv's and 'You get me's and dot in a few 'To you's and 'To me's. 3. Replace the lead's families with cardboard cut-outs. This would not only save money but make them more realistic. 4. See if those custard pie guns from Bugsy Malone are going cheap. If not, I'm sure those suction cup dart guns are still available at all good joke shops. 5. Those two detectives in the station are probably OK, but maybe think about swapping them for a duo who might add a little more gravitas. Could I suggest Bodger and Badger? 6. The station boss is a role tailor made for someone like Johnny Vegas. Again, there's no need to change the script, just add 'And no slacking!' to the end of any instructions. 7. Finally, call the commissioning editor at CBBC and tell them you've got a sure-fire hit on your hands. Don't feel guilty, someone obviously pulled the same joke on you. Right, That's that sorted. Mine's a pint. 56 out of 118 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",1
17,8038720,"This is without doubt one of the poorest TV shows made. Everything is Terrible. The plot, script, acting, editing and continuity. It's too over the top and cringe worthy and is only suitable for people with a mental age under 9. It's the quality of show that first year non film students would put together for a college show reel. You have a bunch of car thieves of about 20 members but each one has a machine gun when there is no need to carry a gun, illegal arms are not as common in UK as portrayed in this show and overlooking all these facts the sentence for carrying a gun is more than for stealing a car and never mind that a highly trained police armed response team would take the lead in such situations (and remove the entire premise and need for the show) you have two 'bruvs' who are meant to be the UK equivalent of the FBI yet are as believable as police officers as Jimmy Saville would be described as a 'friend to children.' 24 out of 46 found this helpful.

18,8038720,"To quote a chap from Gogglebox ""Who wrote this?"". Well actually it was someone called Nick Love - I don't know what he's done before but this should be a swift end to his scriptwriting career. Every line is as banal as the last and the only watchable segment in the first episode was a car chase, where mercifully little was said. Although thanks to one of many glaring continuity and prop errors the red car's number plates changed twice during the scene. I can't fault the actors, they delivered their wooden lines as best they could. The locations were as you'd expect of a 'gritty' Liverpool set drama (no, it wasn't filmed in London), but overall it's like something delivered by a GCSE student, who'd never seen a decent cop show (think Line of Duty), had never been to London, and thinks sticking ""Bruv"" on the end of every other sentence makes it cool. I hope Sky didn't take the option on a second series, I'm surprised they took the first. I can only think whoever commissioned it has never bothered to watch the output on their own Sky Atlantic. 26 out of 53 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",2
19,8038720,Both main characters are great as long as they stop saying bruv all the time.

22,8038720,"The overall representation of episode 1 is confusing. One minute it seems strong, the next it's poor. Errors such as changing cars through scenes?

Watch Bodyguard 2018 series, now that is true quality from the BBC, believable, tense and gripping. I wanted the same for this. Shame. Will I finish it, yeah. 8 out of 13 found this helpful.

25,8038720,"This show had a great Pilot in my opinion, giving you an understanding of both the main characters and their partnership together. It was action pact, not overly dramatic, moments to laugh and really captured the culture of London and what it's like to be from there. I recommend giving it a chance to watch and for it to develop before you criticise on the way it is just because people may not understand the culture behind it. 27 out of 58 found this helpful.

26,8038720,"Growing up with the cops & robbers classic TV series of the 70's - The Sweeney, The Professionals & Starsky & Hutch etc, I was never a massive fan of the duo format except for liking the characters enough to watch. I never followed a storyline, too much testosterone. This time around, Bulletproof came recommended by word of mouth. I dismissed it out of hand, until I was assured the banter between Pike & Bishop was worth it. I trust the previous work of Noel Clarke & Ashley Walters so went in. What a treat. Sometimes you just want entertainment with an edge. Bulletproof is hardcore police work interspersed with personal day to day issues we can all relate to. The chemistry between Pike & Bish' jumps right off the screen. By episode 3, I had become fully invested. Their relationships with colleagues was plausible. I decided I would watch those bits and ignore the gratifying shoot 'em up scenes. Well, that didn't last I couldn't tear myself away! The storylines had me gripped and the series became a white knuckle ride. Mostly because the maverick nature of these characters meant the plot twists caught me off guard at every turn. That is not easy with me. Series 2 followed right behind the last episode - like a good book you can't put down. This excelled supplying high octane action with women in pivotal roles balanced by the the necessary misogyny in such shows, the love interests and round up of some of the crime stories - which we all like to see. Only negative? Every time Bish' came running around the corner or with his pants down I half expect to see Kano (😉). The writing is excellent as is the script. Nothing cheesy. Less forensic thankfully!!! Clarke & Walters are a force to be reckoned with. Big tick. 2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",1
27,8038720,"Underrated action thriller based on the buddy cop format - whilst a lot of the tropes will be familiar, it's difficult to not find the characters charismatic, funny and sharp. The two primary characters riff off of each other in a way that makes it impossible to not crack a smile. Action scenes are well put together and enjoyable against the stark backdrop of South London.

29,8038720,"Bulletproof is a UK take on Bad Boys. Its not a bad series either. Bulletproof captures the vibe found in the Martin Lawrence, Will Smith team up from the mid 1990's. Its a gun toting, fast cars, hard crime, mash up. The main characters, like Lawrence and Smith's, are ""yin to the others yang"". One an established family man, the other an on the make bachelor.This helps to establish the dynamic that exists between the two. The clever banter is there too. Much of it comedic and predictable but written well enough to actually offer some depth to the characterisations, as well. Suffice to say, this is a quality formula that works just as well in a UK context. Indeed, its interesting to see British and I suspect, London cultural nuances, found in this series, as opposed to the US product. 7/10 from me. 2 out of 2 found this helpful.

34,5660206,"SPIDER WOMAN is a low budget Thai horror film based on local legends. It's a derivative piece of work, with lots of villagers wandering around and interacting and very little horror content, aside from an old witch spouting curses. There is some atmosphere built up along the way, but the scares are subdued and the attempts at horror are distinctly half-hearted. This is a far cry from the kind of full-blooded horror that South East Asia used to make in the 1970s and '80s. 3 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink",3
