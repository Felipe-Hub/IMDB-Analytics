Fun!", "reviewBody": "Dead To Me follows two women who tragically lose someone in their lives. This Netflix Original Series is very mysterious and the comedy is dark as the night. The first episode sets up the vibe for the rest of the show and it only pulls you in more and more, up to the point of no return.\n\nThe two leads - Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini - have wonderful chemistry. Their interactions and the moments of sorrow feel like as if they are best friends in real life and just connect in the most sincere and natural way. The acting is also just sublime and shows once again that these ladies don't get enough high profile acting jobs in Hollywood, which is a shame. The subject of the series is not an easy one to handle and to combine it with comedy is very risky, but it really works here.\n\nThe episodes are easily bingeable with a runtime around 30 minutes and every episode has several situations our characters get in, that'll keep you interested while you watch it all unfold. Every episode also ends on a cliffhanger that made my jaw drop, over and over again - which I'm a sucker for.\n\nThe show starts with Jen (Applegate) losing her husband in a hit-and-run accident. She's obviously having many problems and trying to deal with the fact she's a widow and single mother now, trying to raise her two teenage sons. She decides to join a meeting for those who lost loved ones and it's here we get to meet Judy (Cardellini). Both totally opposite personalities, but still connecting in a way they didn't think was possible. The pacing of every scene and episode is enjoyable and kept me engaged throughout. It's fun to see things progressing not knowing what will happen next.\n\nThe events slowly come together as a cohesive whole and we meet several key witnesses and side characters that help our leads develop into different personalities, without losing the characteristics we love them for. This build up could escalate in unseen proportions and who knows what might happen to the people closest to them.\n\nThe ending gets wrapped up really well and it does set up a potential follow up, but it could work as a standalone season. Dead To Me Season 1 is a tale of sorrow and mystery, the latter intriguing its interested audience the most. Don't think you've seen it all after the big twist gets revealed at the end of the first episode. More secrets arise, which cause lots of banter and drama. In my opinion the writers could've made it all even darker with the comedy-aspect and certain intense situations. Who knows what a second season might bring.. Although I think it would be a waste to see these characters disappear, since they are so much fun to spend time with on an evening after work, with a glass of wine in your hand.

Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good.

The episodic format means plot-lines can begin and end more quickly than the movie, characters can be developed more and they can be thrown into a wider variety of crazy situations. The movie had great world-building but could only do so much with an 85 minute runtime, and the show furthers that simply from having more time.\n\nThe show would not work if Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, who wrote/directed/acted in the movie, were not onboard.

The premise of the show, a girl living with 3 guys and hilarity ensues, is not the most original, nor the most realistic. But I find the characters to be intriguing, so that I keep wanting to return to see what happens next. \n\nAfter a few episodes, the characters become more relatable than in the pilot. Jess is totally awkward, and it seems half the time her head is in the clouds, and half the time she's the most down to earth character. Her extroverted nature becomes more manageable as the series develops, so don't let it put you off initially. \n\nNick is a 30-something drop out that still lives with a student mindset. He comes up with some creative ways to not spend money. He's portrayed as not living up to his potential, yet his manner draws you in, kind of like a helpless puppy that you find adorable and pitiful at the same time.\n\nOther reviews are fairly down on Schmidt. Yes, initially, he reeks of douche bag. But he's an ex-fat-kid that now overcompensates for his lack of self esteem with douchey mannerisms. Given that, he's a fairly realistic character with a well developed history. His arrogance is always portrayed in a humorous way, and has become my favourite part of the show.\n\nWinston had his 15 minutes of fame and now is dealing with just being a nobody in a big city again. Fair enough, token black guy.\n\nThere is a lot of awkward humour in this show - the kind of moments that make you cringe, yet you can't look away, and feel guilty about wanting to laugh. But every episode does make me laugh out loud. There's a touch of light drama, for those that just want a light hearted show that won't make you think too much.\n\nOverall, I think this is a show about nothing. Every episode seems to be a bunch of intertwining events that happen, like in most sitcoms, but this reminds me most of Seinfeld (the ultimate show about nothing), in that there is no ultimate destination that the storyline needs to arrive at - no huge expectations or conclusions being hung on the season finale. It's just humorous interactions, some fairly plain and everyday events, and some totally wacky events. Just a bright, light hearted show, to be enjoyed for what it is.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 New Girl--What's New", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1436923417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-09-10T03:58:55Z"}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Movie", "url": "/title/tt9683478/", "name": "The Half of It", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2RlZmZkOTUtMDI5Ni00ZjZmLWI1OTItZmUwNWE4ZWVjNzFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzODUwNzk@._V1_.jpg", "genre": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "contentRating": "PG-13", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301427/", "name": "Leah Lewis"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8159701/", "name": "Daniel Diemer"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8467055/", "name": "Alexxis Lemire"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4402890/", "name": "Wolfgang Novogratz"}], "director": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1226108/", "name": "Alice Wu"}, "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1226108/", "name": "Alice Wu"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0190175/"}], "description": "The Half of It is a movie starring Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, and Alexxis Lemire.

Following on from the likes of To All The Boys I've Loved Before, Every Day, and Love, Simon, The Half Of It is an earnest and perceptive high school romantic drama.\n\nSaying that, however, it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. While its focus on the nature of love is engrossing at times, the film regularly attempts to deconstruct romantic tropes, yet falls into the trap of using them itself.\n\nAnd that's a real shame, because there are things about The Half Of It that are a real breath of fresh air in this genre. I love the way that it shies away from a generic story about the high school social ladder, and I absolutely love the lead performance by Leah Lewis.\n\nBut this film just doesn't hit home on the deeper level it really needs to. It undermines its often genuinely insightful perspective on love with either cheesy or predictable plot twists and narrative devices.\n\nThere are times when the film forges its own path a little more, particularly in a wonderful aside in the early third act where Lewis and her crush, played by Alexxis Lemire, spend time together. However, as a part of the film's overarching romantic narrative, it doesn't hit home quite as strongly.\n\nThat's why I found The Half Of It such a disappointing watch. It has some wonderful moments that should stand among the best in modern teen romances, while Leah Lewis' assured and charismatic yet strikingly vulnerable performance is enormously memorable.\n\nBut in the midst of a story that doesn't really work, and a perspective on love that's not quite as clever as it thinks it is, the film really doesn't have the resonance and insight it's aiming for.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3280780825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYyYjQyMjYtMDVjZi00ZWE3LTlkMjQtOWZhMzBiYWM4ZDMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYyYjQyMjYtMDVjZi00ZWE3LTlkMjQtOWZhMzBiYWM4ZDMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Shy, straight-A student Ellie is hired by sweet but inarticulate jock Paul, who needs help winning over a popular girl.

It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! \n\nI firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.\n\nBack to the Future (1985) \n\nFrom the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.\n\nAt that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.\n\nAfter killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.\n\nWhat will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.\n\nThey really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.\n\nMore than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.\n\nLast but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance.

I have to admit that throughout the first episode I was constantly thinking 'oh she's not as good as so and so' or 'I much prefer David to William'. However there was a lot packed into that episode and the script was pretty good. Come episode two I was hooked and to honest much prefer this version.\n\nIt has cleverly achieved what the UK version has in taking a subject and a group of characters that most people should loathe and turned them into a lovable group, all beautifully portrayed. Real, rounded, believable characters and so many of them too. Many people will have been turned off this by the trailer and thought it's not for them which is a shame. It really is extremely well written with great pace and some superb performances. I love Emmy Rossum and her portrayal of Fiona is astounding. I agree that William H Macy's Frank is more likable since he isn't always drunk and Joan Cusack is perfect as Sheila (I found the UK Sheila quite annoying).\n\nWe are only up to episode 7 of the US series here in the UK and its top of my weekly viewing.

I don't think anyone can deny that the Simpsons is probably the most famous TV show ever. even people who don't watch the show have heard about it or can name a few of the characters whether it be Homer, Bart or Marge, THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THIS SHOW HAS BECOME. After all the success of the TV show it was inevitable that eventually a movie would be made, but to talk about the movie would be starting a completely different review all together, so i won't get into that.\n\nNow you might have wondering why i have got \"Awkward feelings\" as my summary, well thats exactly what i get when i watch the more recent episodes. i feel awkward and pretty upset to be honest, at just how bad the newer episodes are. they are over the top, pointless and predictable. in the first 9 seasons each episode had a subtle moral whether it be about stealing , drugs or other things, but when watching the latest ones i just get the feeling they make them just for the money factor, without actually giving a Sh*t about how they are ruining the memories most hardcore fans have of when the show was the best thing on television. It has gone on far too long , and i know i am in the majority when i say that this show is slowly starting to leave a bad taste in mouths of the fans. They should just end the show now whilst its still \"decent\" , in the 400+ episodes that exist, you would think they have told all the stories they wanted about the family, but no they keep coming up with stupid stories that make no sense, which we have already seen similar ones to in the older episodes.\n\nAs much as i cannot stand the last 5 or six seasons , ill still have to give this show 10/10 , because of the first 9 or so seasons, That is how highly i think of them.\n\nBy Scott Dewhurst", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1389078297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2ZWU2N2UtZjMzMS00NWViLTgwZTQtYzQ2OTc1YzNjMzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2ZWU2N2UtZjMzMS00NWViLTgwZTQtYzQ2OTc1YzNjMzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season", "uploadDate": "2013-01-11T06:35:29Z"}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "TVSeries", "url": "/title/tt0460649/", "name": "How I Met Your Mother", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJjMDEzZjUtYWE1Yy00M2ZiLThlMmItODljNTAzODFiMzc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_.jpg", "genre": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "contentRating": "TV-14", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102140/", "name": "Josh Radnor"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781981/", "name": "Jason Segel"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1130627/", "name": "Cobie Smulders"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000439/", "name": "Neil Patrick Harris"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0063215/", "name": "Carter Bays"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0858657/", "name": "Craig Thomas"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0056447/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0284012/"}], "description": "How I Met Your Mother is a TV series starring Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, and Cobie Smulders.

They were like the wolf on Wall Street, three women hustling Wall Street men out of their credit cards. But watching the movie I didn't see that. There were good laughs here and there but I walked away without a complete story. This movie had too many big names and wasn't focusing on the storytelling. If this film had did more research and took more time, this could have been bigger than wolf on Wall Street. Their story was in a continuous loop of the crime rather than getting to the root of why it really started in the first place.

Even if you don't have a taste for drama and you start watching this show I think you'll love it. All the small moments leading up to the big ones are just timed to well, at the end of the day when I'm tired,instead of watching those sitcoms with the same stories I just watch this show to be amazed, By the warmth of the characters, their acting and of course their timing everything just so damn perfect. It's really amazed me that even after 3 seasons the flashbacks and the story that's going on in the present just make so much more sense. You know in other shows it's usually the finale in which I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and shocked,but \"This is US\" damn it every episode, I feel so shocked, amazed, and excited at the same time. To be able to maintain this for almost every episode is just fantabulous (*inserts more made up words). The amount of issues this show deals with is also quite vast and honestly surprising at the same time because it's so darn good. If any one of you is reading this review do know I've seen shows from Sherlock,BB,GOT to Stranger things and Sex Education, but this my God, it's just so amazing! The reason I didn't give a 10 is partly because I wanted to give 9.5 and it doesn't allow me to. The only thing that sometimes I wonder about is, the only possible\"discomfort\" that the critique in me could find in this is that sometimes they do not give us adequate time to deal with the sudden buildup bursting withing seconds, what I mean is, sometimes their buildup is so devastating that when it comes to rest we need a minute to react and the next second the scene has completely changed. All things aside, I'd recommend you to watch the pilot at least and then you'll understand what I mean ;)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "TONIGHT 9/8c on NBC", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3214917401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5Zjg3ODMtMDczZC00NDQ5LWEwOWYtNWZiMDFjNTkwNDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5Zjg3ODMtMDczZC00NDQ5LWEwOWYtNWZiMDFjNTkwNDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-09-27T00:24:33Z"}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "TVSeries", "url": "/title/tt0369179/", "name": "Two and a Half Men", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI2MjIzN2ItZDg0OS00MTlhLWIzMTMtYWI4ZTA0NGE4NDJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_.jpg", "genre": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "contentRating": "TV-14", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001083/", "name": "Jon Cryer"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005110/", "name": "Ashton Kutcher"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0427489/", "name": "Angus T.

For a \"low-brow\" comedy, it often seems to go out of its way to AVOID a low-brow joke, especially a really well-worn one. For instance, it often has little old ladies and \"trailer park\" type women, without those lame, lame \"hirsute woman\" jokes. (I'd like to see more than a tiny number of \"Patty and Selma\" scenes on The Simpsons do without those!) and there was the episode where Brian makes friends with the elderly woman. Instead of a lot of worn-out geriatric jokes, they made it a sort of comedy-drama! And in the \"Asiantown\" episode (which was kind of hit and miss), there were a lot of jokes of Asian food, without one of those cat and dog ones (you know the ones I mean), in spite of the fact that a MAIN CHARACTER is a dog! I know these are irritating things that Family Guy DOESN'T do, but there are so many funny things it DOES do. The religious jokes (not SO much in the current version as the first one) can be genuinely clever. Where else can you see Jesus looking embarrassed because he got credit for a miracle performed by an Indian god standing next to him? (The jokes about religion on countless other comedies - yes, including The Simpsons - get so \"preachy\" in THEIR OWN right, instead of being \"nonsensicle\" like that.)

They've also found a real charmer in Rachel Brosnahan, who's not just lovely and energetic, but genuinely funny. A cast of bright characters with great writing rounds out this great show. The other guys could learn a thing or three from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nThis fresh-feeling comedy, the brainchild of Daniel Palladino & Amy Sherman-Palladino leaves almost nothing to be desired. This is a full-bodied comedy series that really grabs your attention and never lets it go. Everything from the camera work, to the sets, to costuming is very well done and does a more than adequate job in immersing you in a lush, colorful, mid-century snapshot of 1960's New York.\n\nMiriam \"Midge\" Maisel, the matriarch-in-training of her young nuclear family, exceeds by every measure to be the wife she believes her husband deserves. She dotes on him, cares for his emotional well- being, and is perfectly happy. Until changes happen that sets her on a path she's not sure she's able to handle.\n\nI can name, both with TV shows and movies, many where the focus was to witness the genesis of a stand-up comedian, or where we look into the life of a seasoned comedian, or view the last bits of a comedian's career. Usually the actor portraying the comedian (or even sometimes an actual comedian portraying one) just isn't funny. We see the story taking pains to make us believe they're hilarious by cracking up the on screen audiences, winning awards or accolades, and receiving praise. It never really works, because unless you can make ME, the real audience, believe he or she is funny, it hasn't done its job. \n\nRachel Brosnahan is funny. Her timing is perfect. And obviously the jokes have to be good, so the writers are no slouches either, but the material goes nowhere unless you have the right person delivering that dialogue. They've found her. Effortlessly, Brosnahan delivers line after line of well written material with a confidence, brashness, and stereo-typically New York swagger that has you saying \"yeah, I can see her doing stand-up\". That's rare, and that's very special. De Niro couldn't do it in \"The Comedian\". Sally Field couldn't do it in \"Punchline\". Heck, Adam Sandler couldn't really pull it off well in \"Funny People\". And it has FUNNY in the name for Christ's sake!\n\nThe rest of the cast is a manic pleasure, and the show has done a great job with who they've cast to be her family. Tony Shalhoub wasn't in the pilot much, but now that the rest of the episodes have become available for streaming, I see that he stands out with great dialogue he was given and an intensity I hadn't before seen in him. It works. As well, Marin Hinkle who plays Midge's mom, does a wonderful job in the role. We see her character expand exponentially from the pilot with the new episodes. \n\nEvery fall that rolls around, I get excited to see the shows and which ones I think will swim or sink, and I believe we have a winner here. \n\nWhat may seem to be a standard, formulaic \"dramedy\" really has a feel of its own. There are comparable shows in level of quality, but as far as I'm concerned, none just outright better. I hope it maintains its quality and has a nice, long run.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel | Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2990325529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExMDExYzMtOGFjZC00OTYxLWJlYTMtYTA3MDEyNzA0NGNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExMDExYzMtOGFjZC00OTYxLWJlYTMtYTA3MDEyNzA0NGNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A housewife in the 1950s decides to become a stand-up comic.", "uploadDate": "2019-12-05T01:05:32Z"}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "TVSeries", "url": "/title/tt0367279/", "name": "Arrested Development", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFlYTE2YTItZmQ1NS00ZWQ5LWI3OGUtYTQzNDMyZmEyYTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg4NjY5OTQ@._V1_.jpg", "genre": "Comedy", "contentRating": "TV-14", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000867/", "name": "Jason Bateman"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0148418/", "name": "Michael Cera"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005577/", "name": "Portia de Rossi"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004715/", "name": "Will Arnett"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0403804/", "name": "Mitchell Hurwitz"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0003687/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0056447/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0116521/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0006166/"}], "description": "Arrested Development is a TV series starring Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, and Portia de Rossi.
